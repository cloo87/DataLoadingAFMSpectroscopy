# DataLoadingAFMSpectroscopy

This is used to load spectroscopic data measured using Bruker AFM multimode8. The file type is .spm. 
This file is opened using the Bruker's in-house application namely the Nanoscope Analysis. One of the major 
difficulties is that the data can't be manipulated freely. Normally, one would have to convert all the files into .xyz 
then save them all in a folder before adding them into excel or other plotting tools. 

Using this code, all the files will be loaded at once and can be easily plotted for analysis.
