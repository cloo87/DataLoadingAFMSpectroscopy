# AFMSpectroscopy

This is used to load spectroscopic data measured using Bruker AFM multimode8 (The file type of the data obtained is in .spm format). The data file can be opened using the Bruker's in-house application namely the Nanoscope Analysis. One of the major 
difficulties faced is that the data can't be manipulated freely. Normally, one would have to convert all the data files into .xyz format and save them in a folder before adding them manually (one by one) into plotting tools such as Excel or Origin. 

By using "SpectroscopyLoad", all the .xyz files stored in a folder can be loaded at once and exported as a csv file.
